# file-sorter-python
Sort files in individual folders

## Introduction
This is my second Python program so this is just my testing grounds for Python and Github itself. But I am also using this script for my own sorting.
You can send in issues or changes if you want. As long as I can learn from them.

## How does it work
The script checks every file to see if a folder with a similiar enough name exists and then moves the file in there.
Otherwise it will create a new folder and continue with the next file

## How can you use it
Just put it in the folder with all the files you want to get it sorted.
Then simply open the script and confirm that you want to continue. It'll do the rest on it's own.

## Planned things
I'm just planning on trying to optimise it and make it as user-friendly as possible.
